 README - Clean Boot Service Manager (msconfig style)
============================================================

WHAT THESE FILES DO
------------------------------------------------------------
This mimics msconfig's:
  Services tab -> "Hide all Microsoft services" -> "Disable all"

There are 2 files:

1) Disable-NonMicrosoftServices.bat
   - Backs up ALL current service settings to your Desktop
     (file named ServiceBackup_<date>_<time>.csv)
   - Then disables every service that is NOT signed by
     Microsoft (third-party services only). Microsoft
     services are left untouched, same as msconfig.

2) Restore-Services.bat
   - Undoes the changes by restoring services back to the
     settings saved in the backup CSV.
   - Automatically finds the newest backup file on your
     Desktop, OR you can drag a specific backup CSV file
     on top of this .bat file to restore from that one.

No separate PowerShell (.ps1) files are needed - everything
is built into these two .bat files.


HOW TO USE
------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 - Disable non-Microsoft services
  1. Double-click "Disable-NonMicrosoftServices.bat"
  2. Click "Yes" on the Windows admin (UAC) prompt
  3. Wait for it to finish - it will list every service it
     disabled, then pause so you can read the results
  4. Restart your computer

STEP 2 - Test / troubleshoot
  Use your PC normally and see if your issue is gone. This
  is the standard "clean boot" troubleshooting method.

STEP 3 - Undo / restore everything back to normal
  1. Double-click "Restore-Services.bat"
  2. Click "Yes" on the UAC prompt
  3. It will automatically find your latest backup on the
     Desktop and restore every service
  4. Restart your computer


IMPORTANT NOTES / WARNINGS
------------------------------------------------------------
- Run these as Administrator (they will prompt automatically,
  you do not need to do anything special).

- This DISABLES third-party services - this can include:
    * Antivirus software
    * Audio / graphics driver services
    * Backup software
    * Game launchers (Steam, etc.)
    * VPN software
  This is expected and matches what msconfig's "Disable all"
  does. Do not leave these disabled permanently - this is a
  TEMPORARY troubleshooting step only.

- DO NOT delete the ServiceBackup_*.csv file on your Desktop
  until you have restored your services and confirmed
  everything works normally again.

- If you run Disable-NonMicrosoftServices.bat more than once,
  it will create a new backup file each time. Restore-Services
  always uses the NEWEST one unless you drag a specific file
  onto it.

- A restart is required after running either script for
  changes to fully take effect.


TESTING SAFELY (RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to try this without any risk to your real PC:
  1. Turn on "Windows Sandbox" (Windows 10/11 Pro/Enterprise):
     Start menu -> search "Turn Windows features on or off"
     -> check "Windows Sandbox" -> restart
  2. Open Windows Sandbox
  3. Drag both .bat files into the Sandbox window
  4. Run them there - the Sandbox resets completely when
     closed, so nothing affects your real system.
